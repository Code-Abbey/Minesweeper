# Minesweeper Game  

A **browser-based Minesweeper game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project focuses on **JavaScript-driven interactivity** while keeping the HTML and CSS minimal. The game allows users to **reveal tiles, flag mines, and win by uncovering all safe tiles** without triggering a mine.

## **Development Process**  

### **Why Have You Chosen This Pathway?**  
I chose to develop a **Minesweeper game** because it is a **logic-based** game that involves **user interaction, DOM manipulation, and event handling**, which aligns well with the project requirements. Minesweeper is a well-known classic, and by recreating it, I was able to focus on **core JavaScript functionalities** like:  
- **Handling user interactions** (click events, right-click flagging)  
- **Dynamically updating the UI** without using Canvas  
- **Implementing a difficulty system** to enhance gameplay  
- **Managing state changes** (game over, win conditions)  

Additionally, I wanted to challenge myself by improving the **game's structure** with **modular JavaScript** while keeping the **HTML and CSS minimal and functional**.

### **What Did I Learn Through This Process?**  
Throughout the development process, I gained valuable insights into **JavaScript-driven game development**. Some key learnings include:  

- **DOM Manipulation & Event Handling**:  
  I deepened my understanding of handling **click events** dynamically and managing interactions between HTML elements and JavaScript logic.  

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript**:  
  Using a **class-based approach**, I structured the game efficiently, making it **scalable** and **easier to manage**.  

- **Game State Management**:  
  I learned how to **track user progress**, determine **win/lose conditions**, and update the UI accordingly.  

- **CSS Improvements & Layout Adjustments**:  
  I optimized the **spacing, alignment, and overall layout** to make the game **visually appealing and user-friendly**.  

- **Debugging & Testing**:  
  I encountered and resolved issues like **grid not displaying, event listeners not triggering**, and ensuring the game **resets correctly** upon restart.  

### **Conclusion**  
This project helped me improve my **JavaScript skills**, particularly in **user interaction handling, UI updates, and structuring code efficiently**. By following a **JavaScript-first approach**, I ensured that the game is fully **dynamic, responsive, and functional** without unnecessary complexity. I also gained a better understanding of **game logic, state management, and UX improvements**.
